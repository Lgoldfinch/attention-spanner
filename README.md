# attention-spanner

A wee project, with the aim of helping me organise myself a bit better. 

Using some jazzy libraries such as Smithy4s, and the type-level stack.

To spin up this service, type:

```scripts/start.sh.```

Use this to open an interactive terminal for postgres:

```docker exec -it attention-spanner-postgres psql -U "postgres"```
